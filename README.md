jest is installed 
as we are doing some test driven development

so this is the dev dependancy used by the developers 

first step is to write the function (skeleton (dummy) function)
2nd is to write the test 
3rd is to tweek the function 

so waht is normalization of URL 
eg :- https://boot.dev
      http://boot.dev
      https://Boot.dev 

      all the above links are forwarded to the same website ie the first website 
      that is done through the { Noramlization of URL }

next is the " jsdom " dependancy for the get urls form the html
